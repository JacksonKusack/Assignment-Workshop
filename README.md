# Isotope Assignment Workshop

This workshop was developed for the Ontario Chapter of the Wildlife Society (OCTWS) 2023 annual meeting (Methods in Wildlife Research) at Trent University. For now this will be a public repository, but make sure to download the files that you want to access in the future, because I cannot guarentee this stays here in the same format

The following files are stored here:
