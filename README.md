# Isotope Assignment Workshop

This workshop was developed for the **Ontario Chapter of the Wildlife Society** (OCTWS) 2023 annual meeting (Methods in Wildlife Research) at Trent University. 

The following directories/files are stored here:

## Presentation

A introductory presentation (~30-40mins) that was presented at the beginning of the workshop. These slides outline the background information for stable isotopes and the assignment methods, putting emphasis on hydrogen isotopes for the purpose of tracking migratory birds. Hydrogen isotopes are by far the most commonly applied isotope to track movements of birds, but the same theory can apply to other isotopes and taxa.

## Shapefiles

A single shapefile - necessary for the workshop tutorial - for the breeding range of the American Black Duck (*Anas rubripes*) modified from the Ducks, Geese, and Swans of North America textbook [1]. This file is automatically loaded into the R script from GitHub, so no need to download this file. 

## RMarkdown and .html

An markdown and html file that outlines the assignment process. Much of the information provided in the presentation is repeated here, but this file is intended to be a standalone file that outlines the procedures. If you just want to see the output from the markdown, see this [page](https://jacksonkusack.github.io/Isotope-Assignment-Workshop/).

## R Script

The R script that I work through in the tutorial. The code matches the RMarkdown, but without the detailed descriptions. 

*Note*: For now this will be a public repository, but make sure to download the files that you want to access in the future, because I cannot guarentee this stays here in the same format. Feel free to email me if something is removed here.
